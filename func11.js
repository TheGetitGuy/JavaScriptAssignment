function func11(perfectNumber){
/**12. Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect. 
According to Wikipedia: In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to
the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the
number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is
half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
Example: The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1
+ 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 +
2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the
perfect numbers 496 and 8128.*/
